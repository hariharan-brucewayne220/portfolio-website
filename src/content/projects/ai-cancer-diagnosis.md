# AI-Powered Cancer Diagnosis

An advanced medical imaging system that combines Vision Transformers with LLM technology for accurate cancer detection and diagnosis assistance.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for medical image classification, achieving 94.2% accuracy in cancer detection.
- Reduced false positive rates by 27% through model optimization adversarial training.
- Constructed an LLM-powered medical report summarization system to assist doctors in faster diagnosis.
- Launched a FastAPI backend React-based UI, processing 100+ medical images per second for real-time diagnostics.
