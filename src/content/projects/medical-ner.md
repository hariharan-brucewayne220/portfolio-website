# Medical NER & Research Paper Summarization System

A comprehensive natural language processing system for medical research paper analysis and information extraction.

## Key Achievements

- Devised a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using Hugging Face Transformers, achieving 18% higher accuracy than traditional models.
- Created an LLM-based summarization module for extracting key insights from medical research papers.
- Designed an interactive React UI with real-time NLP processing via FastAPI backend, improving information retrieval for researchers.
- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, processing 5,000+ medical research articles per month for AI-assisted literature review.
